# Aaron's Generative Art Gallery

This is the source of my generative art gallery, which can be found at
https://aaronbieber.com/genart/. The site is generated using the Hugo static
site generator, but I doubt that the Hugo source here is of any real value to
anyone.

Most of the value is buried down in `content/sketches` in each of the Javascript
sketch files, which are all built on top of the incredible
[p5.js](https://p5js.org).
